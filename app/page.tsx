                The Journey
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Christian de Ley began where most men beginâ€”in survival mode. Working hard.
                Pushing through. Scattered across competing priorities. Fragmented.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                The turning point came not from adding more. It came from integration.
                From seeing that life is not lived in pieces. That physical strength means
                nothing without emotional mastery. That financial success rings hollow without
                spiritual purpose. That all seven dimensions must work as one system.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Blueprint In Motion emerged from this realization. Not as theory. As practice.
                Tested through real application. Refined through repeated use. Built for men
                ready to move beyond survival and build legacy.
              </p>

                The Method
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Silence. Clarity. Movement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                First, silence. Cutting through the noise. The endless content. The quick fixes.
                The fragmented advice. Creating space to see what actually matters.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Then, clarity. Mapping the seven fields. Understanding where you are. Where you
                want to go. What stands between you and mastery.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Finally, movement. Precise. Systematic. Action that compounds. Practice that
                transforms. The daily work of becoming.

                The Work
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Christian serves as architect and guide. Through the books. Through FieldTalks.
                Through the protocols. But the work belongs to you.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Blueprint In Motion provides the framework. The tools. The principles. You provide
                the commitment. The discipline. The courage to do what most men avoid.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                This is not for everyone. It's for men ready to master themselves. To integrate
                the fragments. To build something that lasts.

                The Vision

              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                A world where men don't settle for survival. Where mediocrity isn't accepted as normal.
                Where systematic development replaces scattered effort.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Men who master all seven fields. Physical. Emotional. Psychological. Relational.
                Financial. Spiritual. Quantum. Not one at the expense of others. All working as
                one integrated system.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Men who build legacies. Who impact others. Who transform from reactivity to mastery.
                From chaos to clarity. From survival to legacy.
